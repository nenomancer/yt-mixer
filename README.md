# Nenomancer's YouTube DJ Mixer

Welcome to **Nenomancer's YouTube DJ Mixer**, a tool that allows you to mix two YouTube videos, much like a DJ mixer. This tool provides intuitive controls to manipulate video playback, audio volume, and synchronization, bringing the art of mixing to your fingertips.

## Features

- **Dual Video Playback**: Mix and control two YouTube videos simultaneously.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume for each video independently or use the fader for both.
- **Speed Control (RPM)**: Control the playback speed (BPM) of each video to sync up the music.
- **Timeline Scrubbing**: Scrub through each videoâ€™s timeline with ease.
- **Play/Pause Synchronization**: Link the play/pause state of both videos with a single button.
- **Inverse-Linking Volume Sliders**: Inverse link volume sliders to act as faders between the two videos.

## How It Works

The extension detects and works with all currently open YouTube tabs in your browser. To use a YouTube video in the mixer:

1. Ensure that the YouTube tabs you want to mix are **open and fully loaded** in your browser before starting the mixer.
2. When you toggle **Loading Mode**, the extension will scan and list all active YouTube tabs for selection.
3. Select the desired video tab(s) to load them into the mixer.

**Note**: If a tab is not open or the video has not finished loading, the extension will not detect it. Make sure your desired videos are ready to go before activating the mixer.
